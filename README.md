Interesting behaviour:
The AI for Green Hill Zone Act 1 displays some interesting behaviour. For example, it seems to have learnt how to kill enemies as well as avoid spikes. Furthermore, it refers to jump over obstacles such as loop-the-loops instead of going through them. As such, when applying the network to Green Hill Zone Act 2, it quickly becomes stuck when it is required to overcome a similar obstacle.
